# Sails-Search
---
Demonstrates a more advanced search function than the stock find built into sails

To get started lift the sails server, create some dummy data to search through, once created, you can do search queries
using the autogenerated routes.  ie. to search the Test for pageviews table navigate to [example](http://localhost/test/search?PageView=0)

Added functionality is created through the function added to the controller, currently I have to configure the funciton with a variable to map it to its respective model, at least until i fugre out if sails has this already stored in the controller somewhere.
