# Sails-Search
---
Demonstrates a more advanced search function than the stock find built into sails

To get started lift the sails server, create some dummy data to search through, once created, you can do search queries
using the autogenerated routes.  ie. to search the Test for pageviews table navigate to http://localhost/test/search?PageView=0
